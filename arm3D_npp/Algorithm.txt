Pre-Processing:
  1. Import
  2. Resize
  3. Color Convert
  4. Color Separate:
	Bone = [255,255,255,255]
	Muscle = [255,0,0,0]
	Fat = [255,255,0,0]
	R = bone + muscle + fat + marrow
	G = fat + marrow
	B = bone

Bone:
  1. Bone = B
  2. Morphological Components
  3. Find marrow
  4. Bone = bone + marrow

Muscle:
  1. Muscle = R - G - B
  2. Morphological Components
  3. Dilation
  4. Erosion

Fat:
  1. Fat = R

Skin:
  1. Dilate R = __10__

Blurring:
  1. Signed Distance:
	signedDistance = ImageData[DistanceTransform[ColorNegate[i]]] - ImageData[DistanceTransform[i]]
	skinDist = signedDistance[skin]
	fatDist = signedDistance[fat]
  2. blendDistance = __10__
  3. Weight:
	weight[dist, blendDist] = | 1, dist < -blendDist
				  | 0, dist > blendDist
				  | 0.5 * (1 - dist/blendDist), abs(dist)<= abs(blendDist)
	skinWeight = weight[skinDist, blendDist]
	fatWeight = weight[fatDist, blendDist]
  4. Weight to Color:
	weightToColor[weight, color] = weight * color
	skinColor = [0,255,0,255]
	fatColor = [0,0,255,255]
	weightedSkin = weightToColor[skinWeight, skinColor]
	weightedFat = weightToColor[fatWeight, fatColor]
  5. FatAndSkin = weightedSkin + weightedFat
  6. FatAndSkin = FatAndSkin - Muscle - Bone

Next Step:
  1. Calculus how many pixels are different from the original figure
  2. Add an interaction to control the D and E of bone and muscle, and thickness of blend distance and skin
  3. Visualization
